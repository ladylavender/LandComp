\title{Number of grid cells covered by enlarged spatial units}
\usage{
calculate_SpatialUnitSize(aggregation_step, square = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{aggregation_step}{A numeric vector of length one containing a
non-negative number. This number expresses the size of the spatial units for
which calculation of compositional diversity and associatum is required. The
size is measured by the number of rows of grid cells around the central grid
cell, where 0 means the original cell without enlargement. Fraction number
can be also set as input. In this case the following step's rosette minus
its vertices are used as spatial base units. Note, in the case of hexagonal
grid, steps falling in the interval ]0,1[ cannot be evaluated. Negative,
non-finite and missing values are ignored with warning.}

\item{square}{A logical vector of length one. Should be \code{TRUE} if square
grid, \code{FALSE}, if is hexagonal grid is used as the basis of
calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length one.
}
\description{
Calculate the number of grid cells covered by the radially enlarged spatial
units.

\examples{
calculate_SpatialUnitSize(aggregation_step = 0, square = TRUE)
