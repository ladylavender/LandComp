## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* changed title to 'Analysing Landscape Composition and Structure at Multiple Scales'
* removed unnecessary spaces from the 'Description' field
* put package names in single quotes in the 'Description' field
* added references in the 'Description' field
* replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{}
