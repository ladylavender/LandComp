  In landscape ecology, it is essential to analyse the data scale-dependently. This is the reason, why the step-by-step aggregation process is needed in the function LandComp. We acknowledge that this is a bit time-consuming. Thus, we strived to minimize the amount of examples and show only the basic parametrization of the function in the case of both hexagonal and square grid data.
